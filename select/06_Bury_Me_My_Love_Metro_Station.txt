You keep screaming 'til you break down
As makeup runs down your face
Girl, you're the only thing that
Matters to me on this planet that we live on
Shotgun! Kill the words inside my head
She said don't pull the trigger
But I already feel dead
Get to drinking and we play Russian roulette
I think we got a death wish
And we're ready to go
Grim Reaper sittin' on my shoulder baby
Send me an angel, send me an angel
I've been dancing with the devil
I hope I'll make it to heaven
I watch the candle wax burn slow
As we have another conversation
When we were popping champagne down
Just lost out in the rain
I don't wanna die alone
Please pray for me, angel
We'll be dancing at the cemetery
Then bury me my love
I keep drinking 'til I black out
The bourbon's got my mind in a haze
I'll say goodbye to my friends in a letter
As this razor blade kills the pain
Overdose is the way I'm going out
I'll keep popping Xans 'til
I'll never come down
Lost the journey and we're ready
For the next ride
Don't think we're depressed
We're just searching for a good time
Grim Reaper sittin' on my shoulder baby
Send me an angel, send me an angel
I've been dancing with the devil
I hope I'll make it to heaven
I watch the candle wax burn slow
As we have another conversation
When we were popping champagne down
Just lost out in the rain
I don't wanna die alone
Please pray for me, angel
We'll be dancing at the cemetery
Then bury me my love
I'm from a small town
All I got is one big dream
And I can't rise above it
Don't wanna leave you alone now
Like Romeo and Juliet we can die together
I'm from a small town
All I got is one big dream
And I can't rise above it
Don't wanna leave you alone now
Like Romeo and Juliet we can die together
(yeah) i watch the candle wax burn slow
As we have another conversation
(another conversation)
When we were popping champagne down
Just lost out in the rain
(lost out in the rain)
I don't wanna die alone
(don't wanna die alone)
Please pray for me angel (oh, pray for me)
We'll be dancing at the cemetery
Then bury me my love (bury me)
