There is no dream that sings anymore,
That ship sailed a long time ago,
But true as the rust and the soil and the trees,
Lord I still believe.

Gave my right hand right hand gave my right gave my right (Ball of fire burning ball of light)
Gave my right hand to that long thin long thin man (Ball of light ball of burning light)
Gave my wrong hand gave my right hand to that long thin long thin man (Crown of gold crown o' gold crown a golden crown)

Touched his hem touched his hem touched his golden crown,
Touched his hem and touched his golden crown.
Did you see did you see did you see that long thin man?

Gonna bury three dynamos,
Where the trees where the trees where the trees don't grow.
