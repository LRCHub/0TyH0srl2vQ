[00:09.02] When I first came to Commons Lords
[00:13.57] Life was simple for me
[00:18.03] Took the milk from the children's mouths
[00:22.53] You get nothing for free
[00:26.13] Now if I should sleep...
[00:31.68] Bury me deep
[00:37.68] 
[00:47.25] Waging war on those mutineers
[00:51.79] Cut the heart took the soul
[00:56.24] Broke the back of the working man
[01:00.79] Cut the diamond with coal
[01:04.37] Now if I should sleep...
[01:09.78] Bury me deep.
