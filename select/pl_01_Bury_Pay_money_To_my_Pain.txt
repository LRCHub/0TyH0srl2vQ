Something's changing inside of
me
I need to write down before I
forget
You never told me, you're alone
Fury and anger breaks me down
I'm so stuck and I can't get out
But I can only, hate you
(hate you)…
Can't you feel me
Can't you love me
Even if you hurt me
I still remember about your
scars
I could understand, stand aside
(aside)…
Wanted something I can't take
I'll be stronger once again
Don't worry about me, trust me
Please trust me now
Now, I have to see it
This is for my love
Open this heart and my mind
Let me believe
Now, I have to listen again
This is for my love
Remember why I'm still in here
'Cause it's all for you
One more time help me sing
again (yeah)
You can hurt me, I'll still be
the same
When it's something I can't
take (yeah)
I'll be stronger once again…
I need you to end my every worry
Taking time is it for…
You can hurt me down
(You can hurt me down)
I’ll give you my love
You are good as you are
(for..)(what should I do)
(for..)(what should I do)
I will give myself for you
(should I stay this way)
(should I leave you)
(you)
You can live your own life for
you
It's all for you…
