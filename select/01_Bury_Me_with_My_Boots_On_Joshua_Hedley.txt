She made the block 'bout 9 o'clock when she saw my truck outside
The plans we made just yesterday
Well they must have slipped my mind
I was drinking hard
At Margie's bar when she came to say we're through
And as she pulled away, she said
"If you don't change, it'll be the death of you"

Well bury me with my boots on
Underneath this barroom floor
Carve my name into this stool
In loving memory of a fool
So bury me with my boots on

So buy the bar another round let's party all night long
Forget the past and let's raise a glass to a love that's dead and gone
Well we had our fight and she may be right but we all gotta go someday
Well I ain't dead yet but like old Jones said
I stopped loving her today

So bury me with my boots on
Underneath this barroom floor
Carve my name into this stool
In loving memory of a fool
So bury me with my boots on

Bury me with my boots on
Underneath this barroom floor
Carve my name into this stool
In loving memory of a fool
So bury me with my boots on

Well bury me with my boots on
