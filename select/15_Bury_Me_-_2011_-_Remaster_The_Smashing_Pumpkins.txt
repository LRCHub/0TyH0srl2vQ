Bury me in love
Bury me in blood

Shield your kisses
Take your heart
Bury me if it hurts

I love my sister so
Chain, unchain
She don't smother me
Chain, unchain
I'm breathe in spades I know
I'm a jack of all trades
Won't you bury me?

Want to see her born inside
Some things you just can't hide
If you see her tell me why
Why won't she come outside?

She waits
Bury me
